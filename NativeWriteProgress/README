# Calling `WriteProgress` from unmanaged code

## Introduction

This project is a POC on calling `PSCmdlet.WriteProgress` from unmanaged code.
It uses a delegate setup to be called by unmanaged code, and marshaled by the C++/CLI wrapper.
A memory mapped file is used to pass progress data between managed and unmanaged code.

## How to use

To use it, build the `C++CLRTest` and `dotnet` projects.
In PowerShell:

```powershell
Import-Module C:\Path\To\DotnetProject\dotnet.dll
New-ClrWriteProgress
```

C++ project data:

- C++ language standard: ISO C++ 17
- Windows SDK: 10.0.22621.0
- Common language runtime target framework: .NET 7.0

Project `dotnet` uses .NET 7.0.
